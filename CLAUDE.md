# CoworkPowers: Knowledge Work Superpowers

A system that makes knowledge work compound over time. Four skills orchestrate 24 specialized agents across research, execution, review, and learning capture phases.

## Skills

- **`/coworkpowers:workflow-research`** — Research and plan before execution. Asks clarifying questions, searches past learnings, gathers context, runs parallel research agents, synthesizes into an actionable plan.
- **`/coworkpowers:workflow-work`** — Execute a plan with specialized agents (executive-writer, analyst, decision-architect, coach, meeting-orchestrator, task-executor).
- **`/coworkpowers:workflow-review`** — Multi-agent quality review: clarity, tone, completeness, sensitivity, risks, alignment, actionability.
- **`/coworkpowers:workflow-compound`** — Extract patterns, templates, preferences, and failure lessons to make next time easier.

## Match Rigor to Stakes

- **Low stakes** (internal notes): Skip research, go straight to work
- **Medium stakes** (team comms): Light research + review
- **High stakes** (board, strategy, sensitive): Full research + multi-agent review + compound

## Insight Storage

Past learnings are stored in `.context/learnings/` and automatically searched during research. Each insight is a self-contained markdown file with YAML frontmatter.
